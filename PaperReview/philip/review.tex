\section*{Summary}
% =============================================================================
%The paper I have read is about a study about the benefits of the use of workspace awareness tool in cooperation with a SCM tool for a project. The authors of the paper has as a goal to further prove that it is beneficial to use a workspace awareness tool when working in parallel with a SCM tool. To support their thesis they are adding more, and more detailed, evidence to strengthen already published work and also to get some results . They gather their evidence by conducting an experiment where they are using a workspace awareness tool \begin{comment}that is similar to others ones that are already reviewed\end{comment} and using this in a controlled environment while letting two groups of test subjects perform parallel work with a SCM tool. They perform two types of test with two types of conflicts that might emerge when working in parallel with a SCM tool.
%In the first test they use a text base kind of project to set a baseline in how the two different ways of working differs from each other. The seconds test is done with programming. The test groups are given different programming tasks to perform while the researchers simulates a future conflict. The idea of the tests is to see how many and in what way the two test groups handle conflicts that may appare during this kind of parallel work.
